#             Task2 Wireshark

second task is to analyse a suspicious piece of network traffic captured in the following .pcap file. To visualize it you should use Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, and answer the questions below to discover what suspicious activity lie within.

- Which systems (i.e. IP addresses) are involved?
- What can you find out about the attacking host (e.g., where is it located)?
- How many TCP sessions are contained in the dump file?
- How long did it take to perform the attack?
- Which operating system was targeted by the attack? And which service? Which vulnerability?
- Can you sketch an overview of the general actions performed by the attacker? Which are the protocols involved? What can you tell about the payload?
